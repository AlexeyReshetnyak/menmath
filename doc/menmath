menmath --warm 5 5 8 5 8 --sum 10 11 101 11 101 --mult 10 11 101 0 11 --diff 10 0 101 --change 10 2000

Warm up in 5 exercises first digit in range from 5 to 8, and second digit from 5 to 8. Train summation in 10 exercises the first number in range from 11 to 101, and the second number in range from 11 to 101.
